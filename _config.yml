description: In November 2023, I pivoted from a successful career in Mechanical Engineering—where I graduated top of my class—to pursue my passion in Web Development. My drive stems from a love for immediate results and a zeal for writing excellent code. In just six months I have transitioned into the field, launching two major projects: an interactive Pokédex app that showcases a vibrant front end, and a full-stack fitness tracker that I built from scratch. These initiatives highlight my rapid learning ability and my knack for applying new skills in practical, user-friendly applications. With a strong foundation in adapting and learning quickly, honed through my diverse engineering roles, I am continuously advancing in my new path where I am committed to bringing innovative solutions to the tech industry.
