## Who is Louis?
In November 2023, I pivoted from a successful career in Mechanical Engineering to pursue my passion in Web Development. Driven by a love for seeing immediate results and a zeal for crafting excellent code, I am fully committed to this exciting new chapter in my engineering journey.

In just six months I have taught myself key technologies such as TypeScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Express, launching two major projects. My interactive Pokédex app highlights a vibrant front end and efficient API integration, while my full-stack fitness tracker, built from scratch, showcases my ability to develop user-centric solutions from concept to deployment.

My background in Mechanical Engineering enriches my web development skills, bringing a unique blend of rigorous analytical thinking and innovative problem-solving to the table. This distinctive perspective, combined with my rapid adaptation to new technologies, positions me to contribute uniquely effective solutions in tech. My journey reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my enthusiasm for contributing innovative solutions to the tech industry.
