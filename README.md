## Projects
### Pokedex App
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed an interactive Pokedex app from the popular media franchise "Pokemon". The application has a well designed front-end which utilizes a public RESTful API to fetch data on particular Pokemon. 
Features a search bar, interactive number-pad, increment buttons, and a randomize button.

### Work-Up! Fitness Tracker
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Work-Up! is a workout tracker for users to keep a log of their progression in the gym. The application utilizes an Express.js server which handles basic C.R.U.D. operations to a custom PostgreSQL database.
The application also employs a simple yet effective front-end which implements Dependency Inversion Principles, Prettier, and ESLint for consistent, clean, and reusable code.
