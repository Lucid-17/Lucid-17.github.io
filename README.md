## Who is Louis?
In November 2023, I pivoted from a successful career in Mechanical Engineering—where I graduated top of my class—to pursue my passion in Web Development. My drive stems from a love for immediate results and a zeal for writing excellent code.

In just six months I have transitioned into the field, launching two major projects: an interactive Pokédex app that showcases a vibrant front end, and a full-stack fitness tracker that I built from scratch. These initiatives highlight my rapid learning ability and my knack for applying new skills in practical, user-friendly applications.

With a strong foundation in adapting and learning quickly, honed through my diverse engineering roles, I am continuously advancing in my new path where I am committed to bringing innovative solutions to the tech industry.

## Projects
### Work-Up! Fitness Tracker
[Github Code](https://github.com/Lucid-17/workup2)

Work-Up! is a workout tracker for users to keep a log of their progression in the gym. The application utilizes an Express.js server which handles basic C.R.U.D. operations to a custom PostgreSQL database.
The application also employs a simple yet effective front-end which implements Dependency Inversion Principles, Prettier, and ESLint for consistent, clean, and reusable code. 


### Pokédex App
